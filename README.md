# Music-with-AI
Creating music with AI involves a variety of tasks including voice synthesis, music composition, and genre transformation. Below, I'll provide you with Python code that leverages AI models and APIs for the three tasks you mentioned:

    Having a different voice sing a song: You can use AI-generated voices like those from OpenAI's Jukedeck or Descript's Overdub for synthesizing voices. Another option is using OpenAI's Whisper or Google's WaveNet to convert text into sung lyrics.

    Composing a new song in a particular genre: This can be achieved by leveraging pre-trained models like OpenAI's MuseNet or Aiva. For music composition, we can use Magenta (by Google), a tool that can generate melodies and harmonies based on a given genre.

    Changing the genre of a song: You can use music transformation models like Jukedeck or MusicVAE to transform the genre of an existing song. Another option is using AI tools like Melodyne or DAW software with AI plugins to change the musical style.

Requirements:

    PyDub (for audio manipulation).
    Magenta (for music generation and style transfer).
    gTTS (for text-to-speech, used for singing).
    pydub, pytorch, tensorflow, and/or magenta (for AI-based music generation).

You can install the necessary libraries using:

pip install pydub magenta gTTS torch tensorflow pydub

Task 1: Voice Synthesis for Singing

Let's create a different AI-generated voice that will sing lyrics.

from gtts import gTTS
import os

def generate_sung_song(text, language='en', filename='output.mp3'):
    """
    Generate a singing voice using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
    This is a simple example of turning text into speech.
    For realistic singing voices, advanced tools like Descript Overdub or OpenAI's Jukedeck can be used.
    """
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang=language, slow=False)
    tts.save(filename)
    print(f"Generated song saved as {filename}")

# Example usage
song_lyrics = "Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try"
generate_sung_song(song_lyrics)

Note that gTTS is simple text-to-speech, and for more advanced singing voices, you would need a dedicated singing synthesis model like Descript's Overdub or Vocaloid, which would require API access and integration.
Task 2: Compose a New Song in a Particular Genre

We can use Magenta (Google's tool for music generation) to compose new songs. Here's an example of how you can generate a melody in a given genre using Magenta's MusicVAE for music generation.

import magenta
from magenta.models.music_vae import TrainedModel
from magenta.models.music_vae import configs
from magenta.music import midi_io

# Load a pre-trained model for a specific genre
config_name = 'cat-mel_2bar_big'
config = configs.CONFIG_MAP[config_name]
checkpoint = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/magentadata/models/music_vae/cat-mel_2bar_big.tar'
model = TrainedModel(config, batch_size=1, checkpoint_dir_or_path=checkpoint)

# Generate a melody in this genre
def generate_melody():
    z = model.sample(n=1, length=80, temperature=0.5)
    midi_io.sequence_proto_to_midi_file(z[0], 'generated_song.mid')

# Generate a song
generate_melody()
print("Generated a new melody saved as generated_song.mid")

You can experiment with various models like cat-mel_2bar_big (a pre-trained model that works for creating melodies). Magenta offers multiple models, each suited to different tasks like generation, interpolation, and more.
Task 3: Changing the Genre of a Song

To change the genre of an existing song, you can use MusicVAE to manipulate the style of a song. First, you need to convert the song into a format like MIDI, then apply the genre transformation.

For example, to apply a transformation model (this can be an experimental approach):

import magenta
from magenta.models.music_vae import TrainedModel
from magenta.models.music_vae import configs
from magenta.music import midi_io, sequence_proto_to_midi_file

# Load a pre-trained model for genre transformation
config_name = 'cat-mel_2bar_big'
config = configs.CONFIG_MAP[config_name]
checkpoint = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/magentadata/models/music_vae/cat-mel_2bar_big.tar'
model = TrainedModel(config, batch_size=1, checkpoint_dir_or_path=checkpoint)

# Load existing song (in MIDI format)
input_midi = 'existing_song.mid'  # Your song needs to be in MIDI format
sequence = midi_io.midi_file_to_sequence_proto(input_midi)

# Apply genre transformation (this is a simplified approach)
z = model.encode([sequence])  # Encoding into a latent space
transformed_z = z  # This would be a transformation, but can apply style transfer here
new_sequence = model.decode(transformed_z)

# Save the transformed song into a new MIDI file
midi_io.sequence_proto_to_midi_file(new_sequence[0], 'transformed_song.mid')

print("Song genre has been transformed and saved as transformed_song.mid")

Note: The genre transformation step here is simplified. Magenta can help you transform styles by manipulating the latent space or reinterpreting MIDI sequences. But genre transfer is a complex task that would ideally require a much larger dataset for training or fine-tuning.
Final Notes:

    Voice Synthesis: gTTS is a basic solution for speech synthesis, and more advanced models like Descript Overdub or OpenAI Jukedeck would give you more realistic singing.
    Music Composition: Magenta can be used to generate new melodies and music, and with proper training, models can compose entire songs.
    Genre Transformation: Genre transformation in AI music generation is a challenging task and may require fine-tuning specific models on different genres. Using tools like Magenta or Jukedeck might provide partial solutions, but for a full-fledged genre transfer, more advanced models or fine-tuned architectures would be required.

This setup provides an AI-based workflow for generating music, synthesizing voices, and transforming genres, all of which require significant resources and advanced models.
